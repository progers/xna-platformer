This is a [Forplay](http://code.google.com/p/forplay/) port of Microsoft's XNA
[Platformer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd254918(v=xnagamestudio.31).aspx)
Starter Kit example.

The original code and assets are licensed under the "Microsoft Permissive
License" (see the .rtf file in this directory).

The code's a real mess, as I ported it from C# to Java in a matter of a few
hours, but it makes a nice proof-of-concept.
